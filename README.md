Summary
=====

The basics of writing a WordPress plugin isn't difficult. All it takes is a little knowledge of PHP, a little knowledge of how WordPress works 'behind-the-scenes,' and a clear understanding of what you need WordPress to do differently.

There are two code blocks here. 

shortcode.php is a simple plugin that adds a fixed-content shortcode, as well as a CSS file, to a WordPress install.

resource.php is more involved; it extracts from a post a list of all external links, then adds them to the end of the post as a list of resources.
